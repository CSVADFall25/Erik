2018-06-30 04:08:59 +0000,"The main problem (if you think it is a problem) lies w/#SocialMedia itself, in the way these widely used communication tools manipulate our psychological reward mechanisms, encouraging behaviors &amp; perspectives that can add more stress and insecurity to our lives than they reduce."
2018-06-30 04:09:00 +0000,"Like so many things, this isn't all one or the other. #SocialMedia as it exists today is flawed, beautiful, destructive, empowering.

2018-06-30 04:09:00 +0000,"Now, this isn't to say that these numbers are completely useless or always unwarranted.

2023-07-16 23:42:03 +0000,"Would love to see the #SL20B regions remain up and open to visitors all year round (closing only when preparations begin for the next SLB). The exhibits are almost like a microcosm of #SecondLife and what's possible—a great place to take new Residents after they learn the basics."
2023-07-31 11:00:33 +0000,"Just being human is hard enough, but we're also horrifically good at making things even worse for ourselves than they have to be. It's both our gift and our curse as a species, that we can invent so many different ways to f*** up a #life."
2023-08-04 05:20:21 +0000,"One thing that worlds like #SecondLife sadly cannot give us is more hours in the day! Ergo, I decided to finally start a Patreon: https://t.co/BCkfKi53pF With your support, I hope to be able to devote more time to some SL-related projects, including my @SecondLife terrain models."
2023-08-04 14:02:57 +0000,"And my first post on Patreon: https://t.co/f8zNcqFoIq Thanks to everyone for the tremendously positive response to my #SecondLife terrain models so far—and to @InaraPey, @slhamlet, and Dave, Lord Junibalya (of the BBB Gazette) for writing about the project and spreading the word."
2023-08-27 23:46:35 +0000,"If someone says that you're \"overreacting\" and they don't understand why something has upset you so much, it's because they can't see it in the context of your #life. Our past colors our perception of the present—but the latter is often all that other people recognize."

2023-09-10 06:22:25 +0000,"Somewhere in #SecondLife, a 🦊 snaps a selfie in a rather strange spot. 📷 Can you guess where in our world this was taken? 🗺️🤔 How well do you know the Grid? #VirtualPhotography https://t.co/uGiyJ8v6RD"
2023-09-10 23:06:26 +0000,"And in that very same place, I managed to capture the shadows of some seagulls that were passing overhead. Are they real? Am I? Much like the old allegory of Plato's Cave, perhaps what we experience in #SecondLife is just a projection of deeper truths. #VirtualPhotography https://t.co/WMne2KaPXl"

2023-10-22 19:09:02 +0000,"I'm starting to hate the very mention of AI. Even more irritating is when AI evangelists &amp; developers say that we need to have \"difficult conversations\" about how these tools will change society; meanwhile, countless people lose their livelihoods as corporations make us obsolete."

2023-11-16 08:35:59 +0000,"An impromptu digital painting I did tonight (in two versions), just to play around and see where it might go. Made with @GIMP_Official and a @wacom Intuos tablet. https://t.co/gMMdh1GJNq"
2023-11-19 09:31:37 +0000,"\"Enlightenment\" is admitting that you don't actually know what you're talking about and are making it up as you go along. Humans are so quick to want solid, unambiguous, yes-or-no answers, but the world is rarely that simple. We mostly just do our best with what we've been given."

2023-12-11 00:36:43 +0000,"Happy 17 to the inimitable @InaraPey, whose words and wisdom give so much \"life\" to #SecondLife: \"Where else,\" as she says, \"is it possible to see such a rich and diverse gathering of creativity, companionship and artistic outreach and expression from the comfort of an armchair\"? https://t.co/TN2j8HUJAW"
2023-12-22 09:54:51 +0000,"Even if no one else reads it. Even if the algorithms ignore it. Even if it's swept away by a relentless flood of machine-made words, free for the taking and in infinite supply—\n\nI would still need to write.\n\n#art #selfexpression #survival"
2024-01-21 07:31:19 +0000,"After rewriting my scripts to make the process much faster, I'm finally resurrecting my #SecondLife terrain modeling project.

2024-03-13 06:40:18 +0000,"You can write the words, but you cannot give them life. They will only live when someone takes them in, gives them shelter, finds a place for them in the corners of their mind or in the depths of restless dreaming, until your words become theirs and you are one, never having met."
2024-03-21 23:06:55 +0000,"You can wax philosophical all you want about the \"miracles\" of AI and what it will do for humanity, but the reality in the here and now is that it takes away work from countless people while flooding the Internet with \"content\" that makes it that much harder to find a real voice."
